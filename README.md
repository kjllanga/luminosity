## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources. I have previous knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT from my Intro to Web Development and Design course at Syracuse University.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Some challenges that I came across when developing this project was syncing my work to my GitHub account. I have done this before in my Introduction to Web Development and Design class, however it was pushed through VS Code, instead of Glitch. Although similar, I found the steps difficult. I was able to overcome this by looking at the Slack Channel for guidance. I also used the Slack Channel when having dificulties converting my video to a gif using QuickTime Player. Overall, I was able to overcome the challenges.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing my submission some questions I have are more about how front-end web devolpment works hand and hand with back-end web development. Additionally, I have questions on how to make sure there are no errors in my code for web development. Especially because in my web development course at school, we use a validator service online to make sure that our code is able to be shown correctly on the internet. I am curious as to what web-developers tend to use, or if they just tend to use the web directory and console that was used in this assignment. ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would probably include different modes for this pattern. An easy mode for people who are new to the game, and a harder mode for people who would want a bigger challenge. This includes either a sped up version, more colors to be added for the pattern, or a different sounds for each button - for people that are better at memorizing with a sound being synced to the function. Additionally if a had a few more hours, I would also try to add a timer that allows the player to watch how fast they need to respond to beat their previous score. This score could be shown in the top right as an additional function, where teh game keeps track of the users best score and time.]
